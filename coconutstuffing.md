<https://www.theflavorbender.com/sweet-coconut-stuffed-crepes-classic-pani-pol/>

### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups of dessicated coconut OR 2 cups freshly grated coconut (I used frozen fresh grated coconut)
- *¾ cup of good quality coconut milk OMIT if you're using freshly grated coconut*
- 6.50 oz / 1 cup packed muscovado sugar OR grated jaggery in weight (I used coconut sugar)
- Pinch of salt
- ¼ cup of water
- 6 cardamom pods or ¼ tsp ground cardamom (I used powder)
- ¼ tsp cinnamon

## Method
- *Add the coconut milk into a saucepan and heat until it's simmering (not boiling).* 
- *When it starts to simmer, add the desiccated coconut and stir to combine.*
- *Remove from the heat and allow the coconut to cool down. This also allows the desiccated coconut to completely absorb the milk. Store the coconut in a bowl, cover and set aside until needed.*
- Combine the sugar, salt, water, cardamom and cinnamon in a saucepan and heat over medium heat while stirring occasionally until the sugar has melted completely.
- Bring the sugar syrup to a boil. Add the coconut to the sugar syrup and mix well.
- The coconut sugar mix will be runny, with extra moisture. Cook the mix over medium heat, until the sugar syrup is absorbed by the coconut and you have a sticky coconut mix.
- Let the mix cool down to room temperature, while you make the crepes.

<https://addapinch.com/cinnamon-apple-muffins-recipe/>

### Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour + 2 teaspoons for coating apples
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon + 1/2 teaspoon for coating apples
- 2 cups diced apples (roughly 1.5 apples)
- ½ cup (1 stick ) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ cup milk

### Instructions
- Preheat oven to 375º F. 
- Spray muffin tins with bakers spray or coat well with shortening or butter and flour, making sure to discard any excess flour from the tins after coating.
- Sift together 2 cups flour, baking powder, salt, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a medium bowl. Set aside.
- Mix 2 teaspoons flour with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Toss diced apples with the flour/cinnamon mixture to coat apples in a separate bowl. Set aside.
- Cream together butter and sugar until lightened in color, about 3 minutes. Add an egg, one at a time, taking care to fully incorporate before adding the other. Mix in vanilla.
- Gently fold in flour mixture, alternating with milk. Stir until just combined. Fold in diced apples and scoop mixture into prepared muffin tins, filling about 2/3 to 3/4 full (fill to top for half-size muffins). Bake until a toothpick or skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes (20 minutes for half-size muffins).
- Once muffins have baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly in the muffin tin before cooling on rack.

Green Pepper Chicken Curry

2 tbsp Vegetable oil
Half a white onion, diced 
Half a red onion, diced
3 tbsp Garlic puree/diced garlic
2 tbsp ginger puree/diced fresh ginger

Half a green pepper diced

3 tsp Ground coriander 
2 tsp Ground cumin
1 tsp Huldi/tumeric
1/2 tsp/to taste Salt
1/2 tsp Black peppercorns
1 tsp Garum Masala
* This is a kid-friendly non-spicy curry so add something hot like indian chili powder or cyenne if that's your jam

1 tbsp Tamarind paste

5-6 Cilantro sprigs

1-1.5 lbs chicken thigh cut to bite-sized pieces

Steps:
1. Sautee onions about 10 mins, until they are starting to brown/you get bored of this step
2. Add garlic and sautee for a min
3. Add ginger and sautee for a min
4. Add spices and fry for a min
5. Add green pepper and fry for a min <-- possibly I added the pepper before the spices but I don't imagine it matters too mucj
6. Add tamarind and mix about
7. Add chicken and mix to coat evenly. Allow chicken to cook on one side for 5 mins before flipping over and cooking for 5 mins on the other side
8. Add half a cup to a cup of water depending on desired level of sauciness. Cover and lower heat for 10-15 mins until chicken is cooked through. Since you're using chicken thighs overcooking will not lead to chicken drying out. 
9. Turn off the heat and add the cilantro sprigs, giving a gentle stir
10. Serve over rice or with chapati or naan.

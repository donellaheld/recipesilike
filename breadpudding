### Ingredients

- 9 slices day-old bread
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1/4 cup raisins (optional)
- ¼ cup dried apricots, chopped
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- Dash of nutmeg
- Dash of ground ginger 
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Directions

- Prep 30 m // Cook  45 m // Ready In 1 h 15 m
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
- Break/chop bread into small pieces into an 8 inch square baking pan. Drizzle melted butter or margarine over bread. If desired, sprinkle with raisins and apricots.
- In a medium mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and vanilla. Beat until well mixed. Pour over bread, and lightly push down with a fork until bread is covered and soaking up the egg mixture.
- If you have time, leave in fridge an hour or two so bread absorbs liquid. 
- Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.

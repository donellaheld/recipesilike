### Full Ingredients List:

- Chicken breasts - 2 (should be about 1.5 lbs)
- Kaffir lime leaves - 4.5 g (approx  7)
- Lemon grass - 3 stalks (all that was left, use more if you like)
- Ginger - 3 inch (61 g) 
- Garlic - 5 cloves 
- Shallot - 1
- Red onion - half
- Salt
- Pepper
- Granulated Sugar - 2 tbsp
- Oyster sauce - 1 tbsp
- Low sodium soy sauce - 1 tbsp
- Tumeric powder - 1.5 tsp
- 5 spice - 1/2 tsp
- Honey - 2 tbsp
- Olive oil
- Chili flakes - 1/2 tsp (optional)

#### For Steaming the Chicken

- Lemongrass - chop up into ~4 inch inch segments and use inside of stalk. Separate into two sections (put most in pot for steaming after being gently smashed, reserve 2 pieces for mincing for the spice paste)
- Kaffir Lime leaves (separate 1/3 - ugly leaves - and crush gently in your hand and put in pot for steaming, reserve 2/3 - prettier pieces - for spice paste)
- Ginger - slice one inch piece (no need to peel) and add to pot with chicken for steaming 
- Add red onion, sliced, to pot
- Place chicken breasts on top of veg
- Sprinkle pinch of salt and pepper over chicken 
- Cover with lid (add NO water) and steam on very low heat for 15-20 minutes once it's started cooking. Don't burn the pot (use very low heat and check often) so you can use the juice in the spice paste. 
- Flip the chicken over halfway through cooking stage (not including time to heat pot). Increase the heat to reduce the juice. 
- When the chicken is cooked and while it's still hot, shred it into the size of children's fingers (thin and long) then make the paste

##### Stir fry spice paste

- Place frying pan over medium heat and coat with thin layer of olive oil when hot
- Add lemongrass first and stir fry for a min
- Add shallot and stir fry for 30 s
- Add garlic and stir fry for 1 min
- Add ginger and stir fry for 2 mins
- If you want a kick, add 1/2 tsp chili flakes
- Add chicken juice mixture (use a bit of water to clean out the bowl and add this too) and stir over low heat until thickened, about 3-4 mins
- Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool a min before you add the lime leaves (the heat will continue to cook the chicken so you need the paste to cool)
- Add the chicken to the pan and mix to evenly combine but don't over mix (you don't want the chicken pieces to get too small)
- Allow the shredded chicken to marinate in the paste for half an hour minimum at room temperature, uncovered so it dries a little

#### Drying the chicken into Jerky

- Dry the shredded chicken into jerky by spreading it into a single layer on a cooling rack over a baking tray (so air can go both over and under) and juice can run off
- 80 C / 180 F for 1.5 hours. After half an hour check to see if it's drying. If the top is dry, flip it over

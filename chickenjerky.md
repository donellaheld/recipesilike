Ingredients:

Chicken breasts - 2 (should be about 1.5 lbs)
Kefir lime leaves - 4.5 g (approx  7) separated; 1/3 for steaminga nd 2/3 for paste
Lemon grass - 3 stalks with stems removed and chopped into 4-inch pieces (all that was left, use more if you like) separated; 2 4-inch pieces for paste and the rest for steaming
Ginger - 3 inch (61 g) separated; 1-inch piece sliced for steaming, the rest diced for paste
Garlic - 5 cloves 
Shallot - 1Red onion - half

Steaming chicken:
Lemongrass - chop up into ~ 4 inch inch segments and use inside of stalk. Separate into two sections (most in pot for steaming after being gently smashed,  2 pieces for mincing for the paste)
Kefir Lime leaves (separate in 2, 1/3 - ugly leaves - crush gently in your hand and goes in pot for steaming, 2/3 - prettier pieces - for spice paste)
Ginger - slice one inch (no need to peel) and add to pot with chicken for steaming 
Add red onion, sliced
Add chicken breasts on top of veg
Sprinkle pinch of salt and pepper over chicken 
Cover with NO water and steam on very low heat for 15-20 minutes once it's started cooking. Don't burn the pot (very low heat and check often) so you can use the juice in the paste. 
Flip the chicken over halfway through cooking stage (not including time to heat pot). Increase the heat to reduce the juice. 
When the chicken is cooked, shred chicken before you make the paste (unless the chicken is too hot then wait a while)

Remove chicken from pot and pour juice in bowl - should be about a quarter cup (if there is no liquid, add some water to veg and cook a bit to get some flavourful juice)
Granulated Sugar - 2 tbsp
Oyster sauce - 1 tbsp
Low sodium soy sauce - 1 tbsp1 tap - salt
Add 1/4 cup chicken juice
Stir to combine 
Add in 
Tumeric powder - 1.5 tsp
5 spice - 1/2 tsp
Stir to combine
Add two table spoons of honey and stir to combine 

Stir fry Paste:
Ginger - peel 2 inches and julienne 
Lemongrass - chop into thin rounds and then finely chop
Shallot - chop into thin rounds and then finely chop
Garlic - peel and finely chop
Lime kefir leaves - about 2/3 goes in the paste, make a pile and roll then thinly slice

Shred chicken while hot into the size of children's fingers (thin and long) then make the paste

Place frying pan in stove
Coat hot pan in olive oil
Add lemongrass first and stir fry for a min
Add shallot and stir fry for 30 s
Add garlic and stir fry for 1 min
Add ginger and stir fry for 2 mins
If you want a kick, add some 1/2 tsp chili flakes
Add juice mixture and stir over low heat for Use a bit of water to clean out the bowl
Stir to thicken about 3-4 mins
Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool a min before you add the lime leaves
The heat will continue to cook the chicken so you need the paste to cool
Add the chicken to the pan and mix to evenly combine but don't over mix (you don't want the chicken pieces to get too small)
Allow the shredded chicken to marinate in the paste for half an hour minimum at room temperature, uncovered so it dries a little
Dry the shredded chicken into jerky by spreading to9he chicken into a single layer on a cooling rack over a baking tray (so air can go both over and under) and juice can run off. 
80 C / 180 F for 1.5 hours. After half an hour check to see if it's drying. If the top is dry, flip it over.

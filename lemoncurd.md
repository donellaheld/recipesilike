<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019737-lemon-curd>

### INGREDIENTS
- 1 ¼ cups (250 grams) sugar
- 4 large eggs *[I used 3 eggs + 1 egg white leftover from the lemon meringue cookie shortbread]*
- 1 tablespoon light corn syrup *[I omitted this]*
- About 3/4 cup (180 milliliters) freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 4 to 6 lemons)
- 1 stick (8 tablespoons; 4 ounces; 113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks

PREPARATION
- Whisk the sugar, eggs, and lemon juice together in a large glass mixing bowl. Drop in the pieces of butter.
- Put a saucepan with an inch of water over medium heat and set to a simmer once the water starts to boil. 
- Place the glass bowl on top of the pot and start whisking. Cook, continuing to whisk — don’t stop — for 10 or more minutes, until the curd starts to thicken. *Use an oven mitt to hold the glass bowl.*
- If it hasn't thickened in 10 minutes increase the heat slighly and keep whisking. 
- When it is noticeably thickened and, most important, you see a bubble or two come to the surface, stop; the curd is ready.
- Immediately scrape the curd into a heatproof bowl or canning jar or two. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal and let the curd cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.

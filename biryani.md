### Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 1 piece minced ginger thinly sliced
- 4 cloves Garlic crushed
- 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
- 6-8 sprigs mint, finely chopped
- 1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs cut into bite size pieces*
- 1 cup Basmati Rice rinsed and drained*
- 1 cup water*
- Salt to taste

*I usually "double" recipe to ~1.5 lbs chicken, 2 cups rice and ~1.6 cups water to get an amount and ratio I like.*

### Instructions
1. Heat ghee in your Instant Pot and when it's hot, put in the thinly sliced onion and cook until it's well-browned and crisp at the edges.
2. Add in the ginger and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes.
3. Put in the bite size chicken pieces and sear gently on both sides. You need the chicken and the rice to cook together in the same time so don't leave these pieces too big and don't skip this searing step, which precooks the chicken a little bit.
4. Add salt to taste and mix well. Remember you need enough salt to flavor the rice you'll shortly be adding as well.
5. Add garam masala and mix well.
6. Spread out the chicken and veggie mixture to cover the bottom of your Instant Pot.
7. Sprinkle the chopped cilantro and mint on top it.
8. Spread the rinsed, drained rice across everything. Do not stir.
9. Pour in the water, and gently push the rice down so it is covered by the water.
10. Cook on high pressure for 5 minutes, and let the pressure release naturally.
11. Open and inhale deeply! Enjoy the true-to-tradition aroma of this dish and then either mix it gently from the bottom, or serve by scooping up a layer from top to bottom so you've served chicken, herbs, and rice in every serving.

### INGREDIENTS
- 2 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup roasted salted peanuts
- ½ pound (2 sticks) salted butter
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup extra-crunchy peanut butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

### PREPARATION
- Adjust oven rack to low center position. Heat oven to 350 degrees. 
- In a medium bowl, sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside. 
- Place peanuts in a food processor and pulse until the texture of bread crumbs. Set aside.
- In bowl of electric mixer or by hand, beat butter until creamy. Add sugars and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping sides as necessary. 
- Then beat in crunchy peanut butter until fully incorporated, followed by eggs and vanilla. 
- Gently stir dry ingredients into peanut butter mixture. Fold in ground peanuts just until incorporated.
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop dough onto sheet in spoonfuls a little bigger than a golf ball, about two inches apart. Dip a fork in cold water and then press the back into dough, repeating to make a crisscross.
- Bake until cookies are puffed and slightly brown along edges, but not top, 11 to 12 minutes. They will not look completely baked. Cool cookies on cookie sheet until set, about 3 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough.

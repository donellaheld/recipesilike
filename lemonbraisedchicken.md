### Ingredients
- 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed (about 3 lb.)
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon black pepper, divided
- 2 tablespoons salted butter  
- 1 pound large carrots, halved lengthwise and cut into 1 1/2-inch-long pieces
- 2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 lemon, sliced

### Directions
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle chicken with paprika and 3/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. 
2. Melt butter in a large enamel-coated cast-iron skillet with lid over medium-high. Place half of chicken, skin side down, in skillet; cook until skin is golden brown, about 6 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet; repeat process with remaining chicken.
3. Add carrots to pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 7 minutes. Add flour to skillet; cook, stirring often, 1 minute. 
4. Add broth, thyme, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Place chicken, skin side up, on carrots. Partially cover with lid; reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until chicken is done, about 20 minutes. 
5. Stir in lemons, and, if desired, serve over mashed potatoes.

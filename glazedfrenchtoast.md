<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020509-challah-french-toast-with-cinnamon-sugar-glaze>

### Ingredients

- 2 cups whole milk
- ½ cup heavy cream or half-and-half (or use more milk)
- 4 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks [I skipped the extra egg yolks]
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon finely grated lemon zest (optional) [I skipped this]
- ¾ teaspoon ground cardamom [I skipped this but would add next time]
- Pinch of salt
- 1 loaf challah bread (about 1 pound), cut into 1 1/4-inch slices [I used brioche bread]
- 4 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed
- ¼ cup granulated sugar [I needed to double this topping]
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon [I needed to double this topping because I glazed both sides]

### Directions
- In a large bowl, whisk together milk, cream, eggs and egg yolks, vanilla, lemon zest (if using), 1/2 teaspoon cardamom and salt.
- Dip bread in the bowl and soak for a few seconds on each side.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, cinnamon and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cardamom. Set aside.
- Heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium, then add 2 tablespoons butter and let it melt. Place 2 to 3 pieces soaked bread in skillet, making sure to not crowd the pan. Cook until golden on bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
- Sprinkle a little of the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top of each slice, then flip and cook until bottom is glazed and browned, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates, glazed-side up. Repeat with remaining butter, challah and cinnamon sugar. Serve warm, with your choice of toppings.

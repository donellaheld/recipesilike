<https://www.chocolatemoosey.com/2015/05/12/banana-chocolate-chip-snack-cake-vegan/>

### INGREDIENTS
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup soy milk (or dairy for non-vegan cake), room temperature
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil (I used ⅓ cup vegetable oil the first time I made this and it was good but will try ¼ cup next time)
- 1 cup mashed banana (roughly 2 medium ripe bananas)
- 1 tablespoon white distilled vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips (recipe actually calls for 1 and ¼ cup chocolate chips, but I misread it the first time and think it would be too sweet with that much chocolate)

### INSTRUCTIONS
- Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease an 8x8 inch square pan.
- In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
- In another large bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the milk, oil, banana, vinegar, and vanilla.
- Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and gently whisk everything until is moistened, being careful not to overwork the batter.
- Switch to a rubber spatula and stir in the chocolate chips.
- Transfer the batter to the pan. Bake 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (it may have some chocolate on it). Cool completely before serving.

- Curry leaves 1 sprig [1 used a bay leaf]

#### For masala:

### Instructions
1. Marinate chicken in turmeric powder and half tsp salt for 15 mts.
2. Prepare the masala. Dry roast methi seeds for 4 mts on low flame. Next add all the ingredients called for in 'masala' except onion, garlic and coconut. Dry roast on low medium flame for 4-5 mts, mixing them so that they don't burn and roast evenly. Remove the roasted ingredients from the pan and set them aside.
3. In the same pan, add the butter. Add the sliced onions and garlic and saute for 3 mts. Add the grated coconut and saute for 5 mts. Turn off flame and cool.
4. Grind all the dry roasted ingredients along with onion-coconut mixture to a smooth thick paste adding little water. Set aside.
5. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, add the chopped onions and saute for 7-8 mts or till lightly browned. Add the chicken and cook on high for 4 mts. Reduce flame, place lid and cook for another 4-5 mts, mixing well once in a while.
6. Add the ground masala paste, curry leaves and salt and mix well. Place lid and cook on medium flame for 4-5 mts.
7. Add 1.5 cups of water and tamarind paste and cook on high flame for 2 mts. Reduce flame, place lid and simmer till chicken is cooked.
8. Before turning off the flame, add the coconut milk and mix well. Remove to a serving bowl.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup pumpkin puree, canned
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil 
- 1 large egg
- 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ginger
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg
- Dash of cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup chocolate chips

### Preparation

- Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside. Combine pumpkin, sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla and egg in a large bowl. Mix until smooth. 
- Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, pumpkin spice and salt. Mix just until you see a little flour left. Finally stir in chocolate chips and stir just until combined. Do not over mix.
- Drop cookies by spoonful (about 1.5 tbsp) about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-13 minutes, or until a toothpick comes clean and the bottoms are lightly brown. Check one and bake for 1-2 more minutes if the center is not quite done.
- Remove from oven and allow to cool on pan for 5 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack.

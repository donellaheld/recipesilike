### Ingredients

1 sheet puff pastry thawed but cold (if frozen, let thaw in the fridge for 24 hours)
1/2 cup milk
4 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup diced, cooked bacon
3/4 cup shredded cheese of choice
2 green onions sliced

### Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F and lightly grease an 8-9" pie plate.
Roll puff pastry out to larger than the size of your pie plate. Press pastry into the pie plate, folding over, stretching and squishing until it fits, trimming if desired.
In a medium bowl (or large measuring cup with a spout), whisk together milk, eggs and salt. Sprinkle bacon, ½ cup cheese and green onions on top of the pastry. Pour egg mixture over top and sprinkled with remaining ¼ cup cheese.
Bake for 25-35 minutes until pastry is golden brown and eggs are completely set.

<https://www.budgetbytes.com/pasta-creamy-pumpkin-sauce/#wprm-recipe-container-31551>

### INGREDIENTS 

_(This makes enough for two adults)_

- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 Tbsp butter 
- ~1 cup pumpkin purée (a little less is fine)
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1/4 tsp chili powder (not Indian)
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- 2 Tbsp half & half or cream or yoghurt
- 1-2 handfuls of spinach
- 8 oz. pasta 

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Begin boiling a large pot of water for your pasta. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta and boil until al dente (7-10 minutes). Drain in a colander.
2. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare the sauce. Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to a large skillet with one tablespoon of butter. Sauté over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant.
3. Add the pumpkin purée and chicken broth to skillet and stir to combine. Add chili powder and some freshly cracked black pepper. Stir in the spices and let the sauce simmer over medium-low heat while the pasta cooks (about 10 minutes), stirring occasionally.
4. Once the pasta is finished cooking and is draining in a colander, add the yoghurt to skillet and stir it into the pumpkin sauce. Add a handful or two of spinach and stir until wilted. Taste the sauce and add salt if needed (this will depend on the type of broth you use). Finally, stir the drained pasta into the sauce and serve.

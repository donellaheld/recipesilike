<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017319-simple-steak-au-poivre>

### Ingredients:

- 1.5 Tablespoons peppercorns
- 1 shallot diced finely
- 2 Tablespoons butter
- 1.5 cups vegetable broth (low sodium), I used better than bouillon 
- 1 tablespoon cognac or brandy (I used apple jabuka)
- 1/4 cup whipping cream 

### Method
- Dry toast the whole peppercorns in a frying pan over medium high heat for about 2 minutes or until fragrant 
- Have Dave Smey crush the peppercorns using a mortar & pestle (or try a rolling pin in a bag?)
- Have Dave Held finely dice the shallot
- Melt butter in the frying pan over medium high heat
- Add the peppercorns and diced shallots. Stir around for a couple of minutes until shallot starts to brown. 
- Pour in the broth and let come to a brisk simmer.
- Stir in the congac or brandy and let the sauce simmer to reduce - about 3-4 minutes. 
- Stir in the whipping cream and continue to let the sauce reduce until you're happy with the consistency.

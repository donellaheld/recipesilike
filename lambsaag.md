### Ingredients
- 1/3 cup canola oil
- 3 yellow onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1 (2-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and grated
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon coriander powder
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 tablespoon salt, adjust to taste
- 2 cups beef broth
- 3 pounds of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes
- Salt
- 6 cups baby spinach
- 2 cups plain full-fat yogurt

### Slow Cooker Preparation
- In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, warm oil. Add onions and garlic, and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, coriander and pepper and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in broth, raise heat to high, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits on the bottom. When broth comes to a boil, remove pan from heat.
- Put lamb in a slow cooker, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt. Add contents of frying pan. Cover and cook on high-heat setting for 4 hours or low-heat setting for 8 hours.
- An hour or so before it's done, grab a large pot. Add the spinach leaves to the large pot then fill with water. Bring the pot to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Drain leaves and place in a blender. Place the blended leaves into your crock pot, reduce heat to low, put lid on and cook for remaining time.
- Just before serving, stir in 1 1/3 cups yogurt. Serve with naan and/or basmati rice.

### Estimated Instant Pot Preparation
- Turn Instant Pot to saute mode and warm oil. Add onions and garlic, and sauté until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger, cumin, cayenne, turmeric, coriander and pepper and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in broth, raise heat to high, and deglaze the pan, stirring to scrape up the browned bits on the bottom. When broth comes to a boil, remove pan from heat.
- Put lamb in instant pot, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt and cook on high-pressure for 2--25 minutes.
- When the lamb has cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 mins while you prep the spinach.
- Add the spinach leaves to a large pot then fill with water. Bring the pot to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Drain leaves and place in a blender. Place the blended leaves into the instant pot, turn on saute mode and allow everything to warm through.
- Just before serving, stir in 1 1/3 cups yogurt. Serve with naan and/or basmati rice.

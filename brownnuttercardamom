### Ingredients
- 1 cup butter
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1 large egg (yolk only)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup powdered sugar

### How to make

- Melt butter in 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and watching closely, 3-5 minutes or until butter just starts to turn golden brown. Butter will get foamy and bubble. Immediately remove from heat. Pour into bowl; refrigerate 30 minutes or until cooled.
- Heat oven to 350Â°F.
- Combine cooled browned butter and sugar in bowl; beat at medium speed until well mixed. Add egg yolk, vanilla and cardamom; continue beating until well mixed. Beat at low speed, gradually adding flour, until mixture is no longer crumbly and forms dough.
- Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes or until cookies puff and start to turn light golden brown. Cookies will have cracks in them.
- Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Cool 1 minute. Roll cookies in powdered sugar while warm and again when completely cooled. Store between sheets of waxed paper in loosely covered container.

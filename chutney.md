<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021356-cilantro-mint-chutney>

### INGREDIENTS
- 1 cup tightly packed fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 cup tightly packed fresh mint leaves
- ¼ cup fresh lime juice (from about 2 large limes), plus more to taste
- ¼ tsp cayenne powder (so it isn’t too spicy for the kids, usually there’s spicy peppers in here)
- Kosher salt

### PREPARATION
- In a food processor or blender, combine the cilantro, mint, lime juice and cayenne, and blend at high speed until smooth. Season with salt to taste, then add water as needed, pulsing to combine, to achieve a thick and slightly chunky consistency. Adjust the seasoning with lime juice and salt as needed.

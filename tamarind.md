<https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021357-tamarind-chutney>

### INGREDIENTS
- 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin 
- 1/2 teaspoon coriander 
- Dash of cayenne
- 1/4 block tamarind pulp, soaked in water or 3 tablespoons tamarind paste
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ginger paste
- Salt

### PREPARATION
- In a medium sauté pan, heat the oil over medium until it glistens, about 1 minute. Add the cumin, coriander and cayenne, and sauté until aromatic and lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
- Add the tamarind, brown sugar and ginger, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook until the sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching and to encourage the flavors to mingle.
- If using tamarind pulp, transfer to a food processor or blender and blend on high speed until smooth, adding a little water if needed to create a thick but pourable consistency.
- Taste and season with kosher salt..

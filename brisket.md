_Last time I accidentally changed the ratio of the spice mix by halving the salt & sugar and forgetting to halve the other ingredients. Try this recipe again next time without mixing up the ratio of spices! (spices listed here are pre-halved from linked recipe)_

### Ingredients

- 3 pound boneless flat-cut beef brisket (not corned beef brisket)
- 3-4 tablespoons yellow mustard for binding
- 1 tablespoon sea salt 
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar 
- 1/2 tablespoon chili powder
- 1/2 tablespoon paprika
- 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1/2 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoons dried thyme <-- maybe skip this next time

### Preparation

#### Overnight dry brining:
- Put aluminium foil on a cookie sheet <-- cookie sheet was caked with stuff even with the aluminum foil. Try placing a sheet of parchment under the foil next time. 
- Place a wire rack on the aluminum foil
- Place the brisket on top of the rack
- Apply yellow mustard to the brisket as a binder
- Mix the remaining spices together and apply to the brisket
- Place uncovered in fridge overnight

#### Cooking:
- Start at 12pm to be ready for about 5:30 dinner. 
- Bake in oven at 275 for about 5 hours (until internal temp reaches 200F). 
- Move to cutting board and tent the meat with aluminum foil to keep it warm. 
- Allow meat to rest for 30 mins before thinly slicing.

* Last time I accidentally changed the ratio of the spice mix by halving the salt & sugar and forgetting to halve the other ingredients. Try this recipe again next time without mixing up the ratio of spices! (spices listed here are pre-halved from linked recipe)
3 pound boneless flat-cut beef brisket (not corned beef brisket)4 tablespoons yellow mustard for binding
1 tablespoons sea salt 
1 tablespoons brown sugar 
1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 tablespoon paprika
1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
1/2 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoons dried thyme <-- maybe skip this next time

Overnight dry brining:Put aluminium foil on a cookie sheetPlace a wire rack on the aluminum foilPlace the brisket on top of the rackApply yellow mustard to the brisket as a binderMix the remaining spices together and apply to the brisketPlace uncovered in fridge overnight
Bake in oven at 275 for about 5 hours (until internal temp reaches 200F). Allow meat to rest for 30 mins before thinly slicing. Tent the meat with aluminum foil to keep it warm. Start at 12pm to be ready for about 5:30 dinner.

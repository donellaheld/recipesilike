<https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16383/basic-crepes/>

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter

### Directions:
- In a large mixing bowl, combine milk, eggs and butter. Whisk in salt and flour. Beat until smooth. 
- Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
- Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.

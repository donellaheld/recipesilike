### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon sweet paprika
- 2 tablespoons smokey paprika
- 2 tablespoons honey
- Half a lemon juiced and zested
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 2 tablespoons softened butter
- 6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
 - Kosher salt
 - freshly ground black pepper to taste
 - Lemon wedges, for garnish
 
 ### Preparation
 - Make a paste out of the paprikas, honey, lemon, garlic and butter.
 - Use a paper towel to pat dry the chicken before seasoning with salt and pepper. Apply the paste all over. Allow to marinate if you have time.
 - We made this on a gas grill, using indirect heat. The left and right burner turned to medium high preheated for 20-30 mins.
 - Chicken went in the middle for 15 mins and then flipped for 10 - 12 mins until done.
 - Serve with naan and roasted broccoli and carrots or cauliflower.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup room temperature water
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Directions
- Put flour in a bowl. Add water and mix with a spoon. When there is no more water visible, stop mixing. Cover the bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes.
- After 30 minutes, add the salt, gently mix the dough for 2 minutes, just enough to gather the dough into one piece. Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes.
- Divide the dough into lime size balls. Take a dough ball and generously dust it with flour. Roll the dough into a 4 inch round on a flat smooth surface using a rolling pin.
- Set an iron pan on medium high heat. Let it become hot. Place the chapati on the hot griddle. Let it cook for 10-15 seconds until bubbles starts to form on top. Flip the chapati and cook for 30 seconds more. Gently press on top of the chapati to make the chapati fluff up. Flip on direct flame and it will fluff up.
- Line a plate with a cotton towel. Place the cooked chapati on the bowl and cover with a towel. Chapati will stay beautifully soft for a long time.

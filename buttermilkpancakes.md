## Buttermilk Pancakes
*From James*

### INGREDIENTS
- 7 ounces all purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp sugar (1 ounce)
- 2 tsp baking powder 
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 2 cups buttermilk (plus more as needed)
- 1 large egg
- 3 Tbsp melted butter, cooled (plus more for plating)

### Method
*Makes 6-8 large pancakes*

- In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt.  In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into it, and gently whisk until just combined - batter should still be lumpy.  Optionally, for best results, cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.
- Melt a little butter in a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, increasing to medium heat after 5 minutes.  Pour 1/8-1/4 cup batter (depending on how large you want your pancakes) onto the griddle, and cook for 1-3 minutes.  Once the edges of the pancake become dull and bubbles/holes form on the top of the pancake, check to make sure the bottom is brown, and flip, cooking for another 1-2 minutes.  If desired, place on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet in a low (250Â°F) oven to keep warm.

### Ingredients
- 2 lb beef chuck (80% lean 20% fat) 
- 2 medium onion, finely chopped
- 4 tsp ginger and garlic paste
- ½ cup mint, finely chopped
- ½ cup coriander, finely chopped
- 2 tsp coriander powder
- 2 tsp cumin powder
- ½  tsp cayenne pepper (I keep this low because the kids don’t like too much spice)
- 2 tsp salt


### Instructions
1. Into your beef, add coriander powder, cumin powder, cayenne pepper, salt along with the onion, ginger and garlic paste, mint, coriander. Be sure to squeeze the onions in your hands to drain its juice otherwise there will too much moisture in your beef and they won't stick to the skewer.
2. Mix with hand until everything is incorporated but don't overwork it.
3. Cover with foil and let marinate in refrigerator for at least an hour and up to six hours.
4. Scoop out a big ball of the meat mixture and pierce it through the skewer. Working quickly but gently, spread the meat on the skewer with your hands.
5. Grill until cooked.

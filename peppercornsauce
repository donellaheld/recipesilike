Ingredients:

1.5 Tablespoons peppercorns
1 shallot diced finely by Dave Held
2 Tablespoons butter
1.5 cups vegetable broth (low sodium), I used better than bouillon 
1 tablespoon cognac or brandy (I used apple jabuka)
1/4 cup whipping cream 

Method
1. Dry toast the whole peppercorns in a frying pan over medium high heat for about 2 minutes or until fragrant 
2. Have Dave Smey crush the peppercorns using a mortar & pestle (or try a rolling pin in a bag?)
3. Have Dave Held finely dice the shallot
4. Melt butter in the frying pan over medium high heat
5. Add the peppercorns and diced shallots. Stir around for a couple of minutes until shallot starts to brown. 
6. Pour in the broth and let come to a brisk simmer.
7. Stir in the congac or brandy and let the sauce simmer to reduce - about 3-4 minutes. 
8. Stir in the whipping cream and continue to let the sauce reduce until you're happy with the consistency.

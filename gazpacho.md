<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8u58EHx9Ho>

### Ingredients
#### Gazpatcho
- 2 pounds ripe plum tomatoes (about 10), cut into chunks <-- I used around 6-7
- 1 cucumber (8 ounces), peeled and cut into chunks <-- I used 1.5 persion cucumbers
- 3 ounces green pepper (1/2 medium), in large pieces
- 1 garlic clove <-- skip this next time or use a very tiny amount. The raw garlic overpowered the flavour. 
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar <-- I used red wine vinegar, use a bit less than 1 tbsp since I used fewer tomatoes
- 1/6th loaf of Ciabatta bread soaked in water + save rest for eating with soup
- Spanish extra-virgin olive oil <-- not sure how much exactly, I drizzled some in based on watching the video
- Kosher salt

#### Garnish
- 6 plum tomatoes, with the seeds, prepared as "fillets" (see video)
- 1 tomato, cut into cubes
- 1/2 cucumber, peeled and cut into cubes
- 1/4 green pepper, cut into cubes
- Any other veg or fruit you like, I peeled and cubed a half apple

### Method
- Add the tomoto, cucumber, pepper, soaked bread, garlic if using and vinegar and blend
- Add the salt and olive oil and blend until fully mixed
- Refridgerate for at least half an hour
- Plate a bowl with some of the garnish at the bottom and pour the gazpatcho on top. Add a little olive oil if desired. Serve with bread.
